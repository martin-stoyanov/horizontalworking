      <Text margin='small' size='large' style={{ maxWidth: '1000px' }}> We live in a period of internal uncertainty and the human society as a whole is suprised by strange events such as Greek Crisis, Brexit, Trump election. What is wrong with our society you ask yourself? </Text>
      <Text margin='small' size='large' style={{ maxWidth: '1000px' }}>In the times when humans were just starting to evolve from reptile forms, the natural position of a human was horizontal. Just a few weeks ago, more human ancestors from hundreds of thousands of years ago were found in China. Their position in the ground when found? Horizontal. </Text>
      <Text margin='small' size='large' style={{ maxWidth: '1000px' }}>As years passed and technology took over our civilazation, the unnatural vertical position became &#39;the new norm&#39;. The +/-90 degrees horizontal position helps to enhance our brain cells by bringing blood to the left side of the brain (or known as the &#39;leftist&#39; horizontal movement supported by creative professionals) or the right side of the brain (the &#39;right-wing&#39; movement supported by leaders and organizers). The horizontal movement also has the ultra left and extreme right wings, which support working at extreme angles up to 105 degrees.</Text>
      <Text margin='small' size='large' style={{ maxWidth: '1000px' }}>With extensive scientific research, it has been proven that the human brain is ~452% more productive when in horizontal position, while the legacy vertical position leads to blood withdrawal from the brain and zombie-like behavior of the vertical people. </Text>
      <Text margin='small' size='large' style={{ maxWidth: '1000px' }}>With all those facts, you would ask why is horizontal working not prevalent? The answer is simple, yet scary - a group of the most powerful men in the world, known and The Directionatii wants all humans to live their days vertically so they can be easilly manipulated and exploited. They work tirelessly to keep the horizontal truth from the masses and use their knowledge to control the world governmenets and populations. Have you ever seen a soldier or general killing other people while in horizontal position on a couch ? No ? Look at it this way. If people are fighting The Directionatii while standing up vertically, theyll spend too much energy fighting gravity and thus will be powerless against the horizontal, all powerful, few. </Text>
      <Text margin='small' size='large' style={{ maxWidth: '1000px' }}>All may look gloom at this point, but fear not. Little by little, the smartest people in the world are realizing the manipulation of the rest. It all started with Abraham Lincoln, the first to recognize the existence of the Directionatii. He was murdered by a John Wilkes Booth, an easily manipulated vertical sheep hired by Directionatii, before he could spread his knowledge too far. At this present moment, it estimated that about one percent of the smartest people in the world are aware of the Directionatii&#39;s existence - a fair amount, but most of them simply too afraid to come out with their knowledge, for fear of assassination.</Text>
      <Text margin='small' size='large' style={{ maxWidth: '1000px' }}>Horizontalworking.com is here to change that and lead our civilization to a new era of horizontal working, please share this page and let the truth be known. </Text>
